# Aurora Learning Frontend CI/CD Documentation

## Overview
The CI/CD pipeline is designed to ensure code quality, performance, and reliable deployments across staging and production environments.

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Continuous Integration
- **Code Quality Checks**
  - Linting
  - Type checking
  - Unit and integration tests
  - Accessibility testing
  - End-to-end testing
  - Performance testing

### 2. Build Process
- Application compilation
- Bundle size analysis
- Security vulnerability scanning
- Performance budget verification

### 3. Deployment Strategy
- **Staging Deployment**
  - Preview environment creation
  - Smoke testing
  - Feature flag configuration

- **Production Deployment**
  - Blue-green deployment
  - Health checks
  - Automated rollback mechanism

## Environment Variables
Required secrets and configuration:

### General
- `SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL`: Slack notification webhook
- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub Actions token

### Deployment
- `VERCEL_TOKEN`: Vercel deployment token # can be replaced with a different platform deployment token
- `LAUNCHDARKLY_PROJECT_KEY`: Feature flag project key
- `LAUNCHDARKLY_ACCESS_TOKEN`: Feature flag service access token

### Additional Variables
- `PRODUCTION_URL`: Actual production url of the live website

## Deployment Triggers
- `develop` branch: Triggers staging deployment
- `main` branch: Triggers production deployment

## Feature Flag Management
- Staged rollout through LaunchDarkly
- Environment-specific configurations
- Gradual feature exposure

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Slack notifications for deployment status
- Email alerts for production deployments
- Sentry error tracking integration

## Rollback Procedures
1. Automatic rollback on deployment failure
2. Manual rollback via Vercel CLI
3. Previous stable version preservation

## Troubleshooting
- Check GitHub Actions logs
- Verify Slack and email notifications
- Review performance budget reports

## Best Practices
- Always run tests locally before pushing
- Keep feature branches short-lived
- Use descriptive commit messages
- Maintain high test coverage

## Performance Optimization
- Bundle size limits enforced
- Lazy loading implementation
- Code splitting
- Minimal external dependencies
