🗂️ Type of Issue

Feature Request

📌 Current Behavior
The current page has a light theme and basic layout. Components like buttons, sidebars, and chat bubbles are not visually aligned with the rest of the platform. The structure is too simple and lacks identity.

💡 Expected Behavior
The page must be redesigned to look exactly like the reference design, including:

Dark theme with vertical gradient background

Proper layout and alignment of all components

Rounded message bubbles, styled buttons, and consistent sidebars

Addition of missing UI elements if needed

Repositioning components to match the mockup

Application of the following official color palette:

Green: #34d399
Light blue: #00b8d4, #22d3ee, #ced2d8
Dark blues: #1f2937, #030712, #111827, #374151
White and grays: #FFFFFF, #e6f8fb, #707079, #4a5462
